# CMOS-Inverter-Design-and-GDSII-Generation-using-Cadence-Virtuoso-GPDK90-
This repository contains the design and analysis of a CMOS inverter using Cadence Virtuoso with GPDK90 technology. The project includes schematic and layout design, pre-layout and post-layout simulations, delay calculations, RC parasitics extraction, and final GDSII file generation.


The goal of this project was to successfully implement the design and perform a detailed analysis to compare pre-layout and post-layout simulation results.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Cadence Virtuoso**
